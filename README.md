# 🥞 Palacinke lang 🥞

![Palačinke](doc/palacinke.jpg)

Palacinke (*palatschinken* in german, *palačinke* in serbian, bosnian, croatian
and slovene), a toy programming language.

## Why the name?

The reason for the name is basically because in times of quarantine for the
COVID-19 I have been missing my dear girlfriend too much, and well, one way to
pay tribute to her is by naming language as one of her favorite childhood food
dishes. And that's it.
